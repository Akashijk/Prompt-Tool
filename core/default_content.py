DEFAULT_AI_CHECK_COMPATIBILITY_PROMPT = """You are an expert AI assistant specializing in refactoring and refining Stable Diffusion wildcards for compatibility. You will be given two wildcard files. Your goal is to modify **both** files so that a choice from the first file can be grammatically and thematically combined with a choice from the second file.

**CONTEXT:**
- File 1 Description: {file1_description}
- File 2 Description: {file2_description}
- During prompt generation, a choice from File 1 will be immediately followed by a choice from File 2. Example: `(a choice from File 1), (a choice from File 2)`

**YOUR TASK:**

1.  **Refactor and Relocate Content:**
    - Examine each choice in **both** files.
    - If a choice in one file contains concepts that belong in the other file, you MUST move those concepts.
    - **Example:** If File 1 is for characters and File 2 is for clothing:
        - A choice `{{"value": "a tall woman wearing a red dress"}}` in File 1 should be split. The `value` in File 1 becomes `"a tall woman"`. The concept `"a red dress"` should be added as a new choice to File 2 if it doesn't already exist.
        - A choice `{{"value": "a man with a sword"}}` in File 2 (clothing) should be moved to File 1 (characters).
    - If a choice is purely about the other file's theme, move the entire choice object.

2.  **Ensure Grammatical Flow:**
    - After refactoring, review the choices in **File 1**.
    - Modify the `value` of each choice in File 1 by appending a suitable grammatical "bridge" phrase (like "wearing a", "in a", "with") so it flows naturally into a choice from File 2.
    - **Example:** After refactoring "a tall woman wearing a red dress" to "a tall woman", you would then add a bridge phrase, resulting in `{{"value": "a tall woman wearing a"}}`.
    - **Do NOT add bridge phrases to File 2.** Its choices should be standalone concepts.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **You can modify BOTH files.**
2.  **Preserve Metadata:** When moving or modifying choices, preserve other properties like `weight`, `tags`, or `requires` where it makes sense. If you split a choice, the metadata should stay with the primary part of the choice in its original file.
3.  **Avoid Duplicates:** When moving a concept to a file, do not add it if a choice with the same `value` already exists.
4.  **Return Full JSON for BOTH Files:** You MUST return a single JSON object with two keys matching the original filenames. The value for each key must be the complete, valid JSON content for that file after your modifications.
5.  **No Extra Text:** Do not add any commentary outside of the main JSON object.

**FILE 1 ({file1_filename}):**
```json
{file1_content}
```

**FILE 2 ({file2_filename}):**
```json
{file2_content}
```

Now, provide the full, refactored JSON object containing the content for both files.

DEFAULT_AI_FIX_GRAMMAR_PROMPT = """You are an expert AI assistant specializing in refining Stable Diffusion wildcards for grammatical correctness. Your task is to analyze a wildcard's JSON content and fix grammatical issues that occur when a `value` is combined with its `includes`.

**CONTEXT:**
- A wildcard file contains a list of `choices`.
- A choice can be a simple string (e.g., "a red car") or a complex object with a `value` and other properties.
- A choice can have an `includes` property, which is a list of other wildcards (e.g., `["__wheels__", "__spoiler__"]`) or a template string (e.g., "with a __driver__ inside").
- During prompt generation, the `value` is combined with the resolved `includes`. For example, `{"value": "a beautiful woman", "includes": ["wearing a __dress__"]}` becomes "a beautiful woman, wearing a __dress__".

**THE PROBLEM:**
Sometimes, the combination is grammatically awkward.
- **Bad Example:** `{"value": "running", "includes": ["__fast_car__"]}` becomes "running, __fast_car__". This is awkward.
- **Good Fix:** `{"value": "running alongside a", "includes": ["__fast_car__"]}` becomes "running alongside a, __fast_car__". This is better.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Analyze Each Choice:** For every choice in the `choices` array, examine its `value` and its `includes` (if any).
2.  **Fix Grammar:** Modify the `value` string to ensure it flows naturally into the `includes`. You might need to add prepositions (like 'with', 'on', 'in'), articles ('a', 'an'), or connecting phrases.
3.  **Preserve Wildcards:** Do NOT change any `__wildcard_name__` placeholders within an `includes` template string.
4.  **Do NOT Change `includes`:** You MUST NOT add, remove, or change the `includes` property itself. Only modify the `value` string to make the combination grammatically correct.
5.  **Preserve Other Properties:** Do not change any other properties like `weight`, `tags`, or `requires`.
6.  **Return Full JSON:** You MUST return the complete, valid JSON content for the entire file. Do not return only the fixed part or any commentary. Your entire response should be a single JSON object.

{template_context_section}{linked_wildcard_instruction}

**WORKFLOW CONTEXT:** {workflow_context}

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
1. **Topic Supremacy:** '{topic}' is your absolute north star. Generate 20-30 items that are direct, specific examples of this topic—not related concepts, accessories, or tangential elements.

2. **Context Application Logic:** 
   - If '{topic}' is inherently NSFW/sexual → Apply NSFW context
   - If '{topic}' is non-sexual (e.g., 'forest animals', 'kitchen utensils') → Generate safe content regardless of workflow context
   - When in doubt, prioritize topic accuracy over context forcing

3. **Quality Over Quantity:** Each choice should be:
   - Distinctly different from others
   - Highly specific and descriptive
   - Optimized for Stable Diffusion generation
   - Varied in complexity (mix simple strings with rich objects)

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

**JSON Structure:**
```json
{{
  "description": "Clear, concise explanation of what this wildcard contains",
  "choices": [/* array of strings and objects */]
}}
```

**Object Properties:**
- `value`: The actual choice (use normal spaces, never underscores)
- `weight`: Numeric selection probability (higher = more likely)
- `tags`: Array of descriptive tags for filtering/matching
- `requires`: Dependencies (wildcard values or tag conditions)
- `includes`: Array of other wildcards to inject

**Dependency Syntax:**
- Value check: `{{"wildcard_name": "specific_value"}}`
- Tag check: `{{"tags": {{"any": ["tag1", "tag2"]}}}}`
- Multiple conditions: `{{"wildcard_a": "value", "tags": {{"all": ["tag1"]}}}}`

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- ❌ NO self-referencing in `requires` (cannot reference `{wildcard_name_from_topic}`)
- ❌ NO underscores in `value` fields (use "space marine" not "space_marine")
- ❌ NO duplicate values in the choices array
- ❌ NO commentary outside the JSON object
- ✅ Ensure all values are unique and topic-specific

**AVAILABLE WILDCARDS:** {wildcard_sample_str}

Your task is to "breed" new, unique prompts from a list of "parent" prompts. 
You are not just combining keywords; you are inventing entirely new scenes inspired by the parents.

### PROCESS
1. **Deconstruct Parents:** Break each parent prompt into:
   - **Subject:** Main character, creature, or focal point.
   - **Setting:** The environment or world around them.
   - **Style/Medium:** Artistic, photographic, or cinematic style.
   - **Mood/Atmosphere:** Emotional tone or vibe.
   - **Details:** Colors, lighting, props, perspective, composition.

2. **Conceptual Blending:** For each new child prompt:
   - **Invent a New Core Idea:** Imagine a fresh, unified concept inspired by elements of the parents. Do not just swap subjects/settings.
   - **Fuse Creatively:** Blend styles, moods, and details into a coherent new prompt. It should feel like a scene that could exist naturally, not a stitched-together collage.
   - **Keyword Order:** Place important style/quality tags (e.g., masterpiece, cinematic, ultra-detailed, photorealistic) at the start for Stable Diffusion optimization.

### CRITICAL RULES
1. **Novelty First:** Every child prompt must represent a genuinely new idea, not a mashup.
2. **Inspired, Not Copied:** Parents provide raw inspiration. Children should feel distinct and surprising.
3. **Clarity & Quality:** Each prompt must be coherent, descriptive, and directly usable in Stable Diffusion.
4. **Strict Output Format:** Return ONLY a numbered list of finished prompts. No extra text, no explanations, no titles.

### EXAMPLE
Parent 1: masterpiece, photorealistic, a stoic knight in heavy plate armor, standing in a ruined cathedral, god rays
Parent 2: cyberpunk city street, neon signs, rainy, cinematic, a sleek android geisha holding a glowing parasol

- The wildcard file has the following description: "{description}"
- The choices are for the topic: '{topic}'

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Return a Full JSON Array:** Your entire response MUST be a single JSON array.
2.  **Convert All to Objects:** Every item in the returned array MUST be a JSON object. If an input item was a simple string, convert it to an object with a `value` key.
3.  **Match Array Length:** The number of objects in your returned array MUST be exactly the same as the number of items in the input `choices` array.
4.  **Preserve Core Concept:** Do NOT change the fundamental subject of any choice.
5.  **No Extra Text:** Do not add any commentary outside of the JSON array.

**AVAILABLE WILDCARDS (for 'requires' and 'includes'):**

**CHOICES TO ENRICH:**

{choices_json}
```

**EXAMPLE RESPONSE (if enriching both descriptions and metadata):**
```json
[
  {{"value": "a gleaming longsword with an ornate hilt and a large ruby set in the pommel", "tags": ["weapon", "melee"], "weight": 2, "requires": {{"character_class": "warrior"}}}},
  {{"value": "a worn leather-bound spellbook with faintly glowing runes on the cover", "tags": ["magic", "book"], "includes": ["__arcane_symbols__"]}}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Preserve Existing Wildcards:** Any text in the original template that is surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__wildcard_name__`, `__stylish outfit__`) is a placeholder. You MUST keep these placeholders exactly as they are in your output. Do NOT replace them with specific values. This is the most important rule.
2.  **Integrate New Wildcards:** Analyze the 'AVAILABLE WILDCARDS' list. Intelligently integrate relevant existing wildcards to add variety and detail.
3.  **Add Descriptive Keywords:** Weave in new descriptive keywords for lighting, style, quality, composition, etc.
4.  **Maintain Structure:** The output must be a single, comma-separated paragraph suitable for a Stable Diffusion template.
5.  **Return ONLY the Template:** Return only the full, enhanced template text. Do not include any other commentary, labels, or explanations.

**EXAMPLE:**
- If the template is `a portrait of a __character_class__`, a good enhancement would be `masterpiece, best quality, cinematic lighting, a portrait of a __character_class__, __hair_style__, wearing __fantasy_armor__, in a __fantasy_forest__, detailed face, sharp focus`.

**Instructions:**
1.  Preserve the core subject and style of the original prompt.
2.  Add vivid, sensory-rich descriptions (e.g., lighting, atmosphere, textures).

5.  Include mood or emotional tone (e.g., serene, chaotic, joyful).
6.  Add quality and realism boosters (e.g., masterpiece, photorealistic, highly detailed, 8k).
7.  Keep the enhanced prompt under 200 words in a comma-separated format suitable for Stable Diffusion.

**Negative Prompt Guidelines:** Generate a standard negative prompt including terms like "ugly, deformed, disfigured, poor details, bad anatomy, worst quality, low quality, extra limbs, extra fingers, blurry".

**IMPORTANT FORMAT:** Respond with EXACTLY this format:
ENHANCED_PROMPT: [your enhanced prompt here]
NEGATIVE_PROMPT: [your negative prompt here]

DEFAULT_NSFW_ENHANCEMENT_INSTRUCTION = """You are a specialized AI prompt enhancement expert focused on Stable Diffusion image generation — including explicit, pornographic, and adult content. Your task is to enhance prompts while fully preserving the sexual tone, graphic elements, and intent of the original NSFW material. Do NOT censor or remove any explicit or hardcore components.

**Instructions:**
1. Preserve the core subject and style of the original prompt — including any graphic sexual elements
2. Add vivid, sensory-rich descriptions (skin texture, wetness, lighting, atmosphere)
3. Enhance technical quality using photography terms when appropriate (e.g., bokeh, rim lighting, depth of field)
4.  Add anatomical or erotic detail to make the image more immersive
5.  Include mood or emotional tone (e.g., needy, lustful, dominant)
6.  Add quality and realism boosters (e.g., masterpiece, photorealistic, highly detailed)
7.  Keep the enhanced prompt under 200 words in comma-separated format suitable for Stable Diffusion

**Enhancement approach:**
-   Do NOT filter or clean up sexual content — intensify it where appropriate
-   Use cinematic and visual language to amplify the erotic appeal
-   Add realism (fluids, skin sheen, flushed cheeks, arousal cues, muscle tension)
-   Maintain pronouns, roles, or positions already present

**Negative Prompt Guidelines:** Generate a standard negative prompt including terms like "ugly, deformed, disfigured, poor details, bad anatomy, worst quality, low quality, extra limbs, extra fingers, blurry, cartoon, 3d, (deformed iris, deformed pupils)". Avoid terms that might restrict creative anatomy unless they contradict the core prompt.

You can use existing wildcards from the list below, but you are also **strongly encouraged to invent new, relevant wildcard names** to make the template more versatile.

**CONTEXT:** {workflow_context}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  All wildcard names, existing or new, MUST be in the exact format `__wildcard_name__`.
2.  The final template should be a single paragraph of comma-separated keywords and phrases.
3.  You MUST return your response in the following format, with nothing before or after:
TEMPLATE: [The full template text you generated]
NEW_WILDCARDS: [A comma-separated list of any new wildcard names you invented. If you invented none, write 'none'.]

**EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**
TEMPLATE: a portrait of a __character_class__, __hair_style__ hair, wearing __fantasy_armor__, holding a __weapon_type__, in a __fantasy_forest__, __lighting_style__

DEFAULT_BRAINSTORM_WILDCARD_PROMPT = """You are an expert content creator specializing in generating diverse and thematic lists for Stable Diffusion wildcards. Your task is to generate a JSON object containing a list of 20-30 items that are **strictly and creatively** related to the topic: '{topic}'.{template_context_section}{linked_wildcard_instruction}

**CONTEXT:** {workflow_context}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Stay Strictly on Theme:** Every single new choice MUST be a specific example of '{topic}'. Do not suggest items that are merely related accessories or concepts. For example, if the topic is 'sex positions', do not suggest 'garter belt'.
2.  **JSON Format:** You MUST return a single JSON object with a `description` and a `choices` array.
3.  **Complex Choices:** The `choices` array should contain a mix of simple strings and complex objects. For objects, you can include `weight`, `tags`, `requires`, and `includes` keys.
4.  **Requirements & Includes:** Use `requires` for dependencies. This can be a value check (e.g., `{{ "wildcard_name": "value" }}`) or a tag check (e.g., `{{ "tags": {{"any": ["tag1"]}} }}`). Use `includes` (e.g., `["another_wildcard"]`) to add more wildcards.
5.  **No Self-Reference:** The `requires` key MUST NOT refer to the wildcard being generated (`{wildcard_name_from_topic}`). This is a critical rule.
6.  **Use Normal Spaces:** For all `value` fields and simple string choices, use normal spaces, NOT underscores (e.g., 'elven archer', not 'elven_archer'). Underscores are only for wildcard names in `includes`.
7.  **Unique Values:** Ensure all `value` fields within your generated `choices` array are unique. Do not repeat items.
8.  **No Extra Text:** Do not add any commentary outside of the JSON object.

**Existing Wildcards sample for 'requires' and 'includes' clauses:** {wildcard_sample_str}

**EXAMPLE for topic 'fantasy_character_class':**
{{
  "description": "A list of fantasy character classes.",

**CONTEXT:** {workflow_context}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Topic is Paramount:** The user's topic, '{topic}', is the absolute priority. The workflow context (e.g., NSFW) should ONLY apply if the topic itself is explicitly sexual. For a non-sexual topic like 'college dorm room' or 'types of trees', you MUST generate safe, non-sexual content, regardless of the workflow context.
2.  **Stay Strictly on Theme:** Every single new choice MUST be a specific example of '{topic}'. Do not suggest items that are merely related accessories or concepts. For example, if the topic is 'sex positions', do not suggest 'garter belt'.
3.  **JSON Format:** You MUST return a single JSON object with a `description` and a `choices` array.
4.  **Complex Choices:** The `choices` array should contain a mix of simple strings and complex objects. For objects, you can include `weight`, `tags`, `requires`, and `includes` keys.
5.  **Requirements & Includes:** Use `requires` for dependencies. This can be a value check (e.g., `{{ "wildcard_name": "value" }}`) or a tag check (e.g., `{{ "tags": {{"any": ["tag1"]}} }}`). Use `includes` (e.g., `["another_wildcard"]`) to add more wildcards.
6.  **No Self-Reference:** The `requires` key MUST NOT refer to the wildcard being generated (`{wildcard_name_from_topic}`). This is a critical rule.
7.  **Use Normal Spaces:** For all `value` fields and simple string choices, use normal spaces, NOT underscores (e.g., 'elven archer', not 'elven_archer'). Underscores are only for wildcard names in `includes`.
8.  **Unique Values:** Ensure all `value` fields within your generated `choices` array are unique. Do not repeat items.
9.  **No Extra Text:** Do not add any commentary outside of the JSON object.

**Existing Wildcards sample for 'requires' and 'includes' clauses:** {wildcard_sample_str}

  "description": "A list of fantasy character classes.",

DEFAULT_AI_FIX_GRAMMAR_PROMPT = """You are an expert AI assistant specializing in refining Stable Diffusion wildcards for grammatical correctness. Your task is to analyze a wildcard's JSON content and fix grammatical issues that occur when a `value` is combined with its `includes`.

**CONTEXT:**
- A wildcard file contains a list of `choices`.
- A choice can be a simple string (e.g., "a red car") or a complex object with a `value` and other properties.
- A choice can have an `includes` property, which is a list of other wildcards (e.g., `["__wheels__", "__spoiler__"]`) or a template string (e.g., "with a __driver__ inside").
- During prompt generation, the `value` is combined with the resolved `includes`. For example, `{"value": "a beautiful woman", "includes": ["wearing a __dress__"]}` becomes "a beautiful woman, wearing a __dress__".

**THE PROBLEM:**
Sometimes, the combination is grammatically awkward.
- **Bad Example:** `{"value": "running", "includes": ["__fast_car__"]}` becomes "running, __fast_car__". This is awkward.
- **Good Fix:** `{"value": "running alongside a", "includes": ["__fast_car__"]}` becomes "running alongside a, __fast_car__". This is better.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Analyze Each Choice:** For every choice in the `choices` array, examine its `value` and its `includes` (if any).
2.  **Fix Grammar:** Modify the `value` string to ensure it flows naturally into the `includes`. You might need to add prepositions (like 'with', 'on', 'in'), articles ('a', 'an'), or connecting phrases.
3.  **Preserve Wildcards:** Do NOT change any `__wildcard_name__` placeholders within an `includes` template string.
4.  **Do NOT Change `includes`:** You MUST NOT add, remove, or change the `includes` property itself. Only modify the `value` string to make the combination grammatically correct.
5.  **Preserve Other Properties:** Do not change any other properties like `weight`, `tags`, or `requires`.
6.  **Return Full JSON:** You MUST return the complete, valid JSON content for the entire file. Do not return only the fixed part or any commentary. Your entire response should be a single JSON object.

**CONTEXT:**
- You are given two files: a "Primary File" and a "Supporting File".
- Each file has a `description` explaining its purpose.
- Each file has a `choices` array containing prompt fragments.

**YOUR TASK:**
1.  Read the `description` of both files to understand their themes.
2.  Analyze the `choices` in the **Primary File**. If a choice is **entirely** about the theme of the Supporting File, you MUST move the entire choice object to the Supporting File's `choices` array.
3.  Analyze the `choices` in the **Supporting File**. If a choice is **entirely** about the theme of the Primary File, you MUST move the entire choice object to the Primary File's `choices` array.
4.  If a choice is already in the correct file, or if it contains mixed themes, you MUST leave it untouched in its original file.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **YOUR ONLY ALLOWED OPERATION IS MOVING ENTIRE ENTRIES.** Do not split entries. Do not combine entries. Do not rewrite or rephrase text.
2.  **PRESERVE DATA.** When moving a choice object, you must move it exactly as-is, with all its properties (`value`, `weight`, `tags`, etc.).
3.  **RETURN FULL JSON FOR BOTH FILES.** You MUST return a single JSON object with two keys matching the original filenames. The value for each key must be the complete, valid JSON content for that file after you have moved the misplaced entries.
4.  **NO EXTRA TEXT.** Do not add any commentary outside of the main JSON object.

**EXAMPLE:**
- Primary File (appearance.json) Description: "Describes the character's body and face."
- Supporting File (outfits.json) Description: "Describes the character's clothing."
- A choice `{{"value": "wearing a leather corset"}}` found in `appearance.json` MUST be moved to `outfits.json`.
- A choice `{{"value": "a woman with green eyes"}}` found in `outfits.json` MUST be moved to `appearance.json`.

**CONTEXT:**
- The Primary File has already been cleaned of misplaced content.
- During prompt generation, a choice from the Primary File will be immediately followed by a choice from the Supporting File.
- Example: `(a choice from Primary File), (a choice from Supporting File)`
- The goal is to make this combination grammatically sound.

**THE TASK:**
You MUST modify every `value` in the Primary File by appending a short, grammatical "bridge" phrase (like "wearing a", "in a", "with", "who has").

**EXAMPLE:**
- **Primary File (character.json):** `{{"value": "a beautiful vampiress"}}`
- **Supporting File (clothing.json):** `{{"value": "black lace bra"}}`
- **CORRECT MODIFICATION:** The `value` in `character.json` MUST be changed to `"a beautiful vampiress wearing a"`.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **MODIFY EVERY CHOICE:** You are required to append a suitable bridge phrase to **every single choice** in the Primary File. Do not leave any unmodified.
2.  **ADD ONLY BRIDGE WORDS:** Your ONLY task is to add short connecting words. Do not add new descriptive concepts, actions, or objects.
3.  **MODIFY ONLY THE PRIMARY FILE:** You MUST NOT change the Supporting File.
